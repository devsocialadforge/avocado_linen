1. Typography

To match the elegant yet modern feel of the logo, here are the best font pairings from Google Fonts:

Headings (H1–H6):
Playfair Display (serif, elegant, timeless, fashion-oriented)
Alternative: Cormorant Garamond for a more editorial look.

Body Text (Paragraphs, UI Text):
Montserrat (clean, modern sans-serif for easy readability)
Alternative: Raleway for a slightly more refined tone.

Example pairing:

H1: Playfair Display Bold

H2–H6: Playfair Display SemiBold

Body: Montserrat Regular

Links/Buttons: Montserrat Medium

2. Color Palette

Inspired by the logo’s pink background and white minimalist line art.

Primary (Brand Pink): #E7647C
(from the logo background, feminine and bold)

Secondary (Leaf Green): #6BBF59
(to reflect natural, fresh elegance, balancing the pink)

Accent (Soft Gold/Beige): #EACDA3
(luxury, warmth, good for highlights and CTAs)

Background (Off-White): #FAF9F7
(clean, soft, fashion-forward backdrop)

Text (Charcoal Gray): #2E2E2E
(professional, easy to read, balances the pink tones)
